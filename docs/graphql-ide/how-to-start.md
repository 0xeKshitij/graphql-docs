# How to Start

The simplest way to create and run a query is to use the IDE: https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide. You first have to register, and the IDE window will open.

Query editor is in the center of the screen, and you can use handy Ctrl-Space key combination to see all possible options that you can enter at edit point. On the empty editor, it will show the drop-down list:

Note:  GraphQL API = GraphQL Query (We use these terms interchangeably.)

**Bitquery Explorer**

We have built our multi [blockchain explorer](http://explorer.bitquery.io/) to showcase our APIs, Therefore for beginners, I recommend first check our explorer.

You can enter your token, transaction, address anything and search for it. Once you see the relevant data you can click on the "graphql" button at the bottom right corner to check what GrpahQL query is responsible for that data. I highly recommend searching our explorer first before

## Check our IDE - Examples

We have built our [GraphQL IDE](https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide) to make it easy to work with blockchain data. Using our IDE you can create, save, test, and share your GraphQL queries.

You can find a lot of query examples created by our community on our IDE, I recommend checking them first, most probably someone already build the query which you are looking for.

## Query Builder

We also have a Query Builder on our [IDE](https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide) which is built to help you create our queries easily. This way you can create queries with simple clicks.
