# Overview

Bitquery 's infrastructure provides you access to historical and real-time blockchain data through various interfaces such as GraphQL APIs. In this documentation
we will show you how to get blockchain data from 40+ chains via graphQL.


##  GraphQL Query

Get started with our APIs in a minute by building your [first query](https://ide.bitquery.io/Your-First-Query).

You can query archive, real-time or combined dataset based on your requirements.

After the query is built you can save it and embed it in your application using pre-cooked code snippet in any popular programming language.
