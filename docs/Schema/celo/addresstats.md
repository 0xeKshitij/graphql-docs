# Address Stats

The `addressstats` field allows us to retrieves statistics related to blockchain addresses.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to retrieve statistics about a smart contract:

```
{
  ethereum (network: celo_mainnet){
    addressStats(address: {is: "address here"}) {
      address {
        balance
        callTxCount
        calledTxCount
        daysWithReceived
        daysWithSent
        daysWithTransactions
        daysWithTransfers
        feeAmount
        otherTxCount
        receiveAmount
        receiveFromCurrencies
        receiveTxCount
        receiveFromCount
        sendAmount
        sendToCount
        sendToCurrencies
        sendTxCount
      }
    }
  }
}
```
