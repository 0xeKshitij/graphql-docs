# Overview

EOS is a open-source blockchain network focused on building high-performance blockchain platforms on top of the network.
Bitquery's EOS API provides you data on proposers, smart contract calls, transactions and tokens on the network.

You also have an [EOS Explorer](https://explorer.bitquery.io/eos) for easy access to EOS data.
