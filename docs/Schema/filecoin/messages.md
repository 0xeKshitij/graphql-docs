# Messages

According to the [official Filecoin documentation](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/the-blockchain/blocks-and-tipsets/),

> A  _message_  represents communication between two actors, and thus
> changes in network state. The messages are listed in their order of
> appearance, deduplicated and returned in canonical order of execution.
> So, in other words, a block describes all changes to the network state
> in a given epoch.
