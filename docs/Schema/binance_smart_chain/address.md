# Address

The `address` allows us to retrieve information about a specific address.

Here is an example that demonstrates how to retrieve basic information about the USDT smart contract:

```
query {
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    address(address: {is: "0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955"}) {
      smartContract {
        attributes {
          address {
            address
            annotation
          }
          name
          value
          type
        }
        contractType
        protocolType
        currency {
          decimals
          name
          symbol
          tokenType
        }
      }
      balance
      annotation
      address
    }
  }
}
```
