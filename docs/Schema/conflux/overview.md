# Overview

Bitquery provides APIs to access Conflux data. You can get info on the conflux  chain which uses the Tree-Graph consensus, a consensus method with parallel-processing to reach distributed consensus. 

These APIs provide details on transactions, trades, addresses and so on. The easiest way to start is through the [Conflux Hydra Explorer](https://explorer.bitquery.io/conflux_hydra)
